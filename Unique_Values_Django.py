In Django ORM, you can get unique values using the distinct() method. Here's an example:

Suppose you have a model called Book with a field called author. To get a list of unique authors, you can use the following query:


unique_authors = Book.objects.values('author').distinct()




This will return a QuerySet with unique authors.

If you want to order the unique authors by a certain field, you can chain the order_by() method:



unique_authors = Book.objects.values('author').distinct().order_by('author')



This will order the unique authors by the author field in ascending order.

Note that the distinct() method only works on QuerySets that have at least one field specified in the values() method.
