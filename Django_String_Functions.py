  STRING/ TEXT FUNCTIONS
  ******************************************************************************************************************************************
  These functions allow you to perform operations on text fields. Examples include Concat, Upper, Lower, and Substring.
  
  
  
 Concat: This function concatenates two or more string fields together.

Left: This function returns a specified number of characters from the beginning (left) of a string field.

Length: This function returns the length of a string field.

Lower: This function converts a string field to lowercase.

LPad: This function pads a string field on the left (beginning) with a specified character until it reaches a specified length.

LTrim: This function removes any whitespace characters from the beginning (left) of a string field.

MD5: This function returns the MD5 hash of a string field.

Ord: This function returns the ASCII code for the first character of a string field.

Repeat: This function repeats a string field a specified number of times.

Replace: This function replaces all occurrences of a specified substring within a string field with another specified substring.

Reverse: This function reverses the characters in a string field.

Right: This function returns a specified number of characters from the end (right) of a string field.

RPad: This function pads a string field on the right (end) with a specified character until it reaches a specified length.

RTrim: This function removes any whitespace characters from the end (right) of a string field.

StrIndex: This function returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified substring within a string field.

Substr: This function returns a specified substring from within a string field.

Trim: This function removes any whitespace characters from the beginning and end of a string field.

Upper: This function converts a string field to uppercase.

In addition, you also listed some hash functions (SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512). 
These are cryptographic hash functions that take an input string and return a fixed-length hash value.
They are used for security purposes, such as generating unique identifiers for passwords or other sensitive data.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Sure! Here are some examples of text-related database functions in Django:

Concat:
  This function allows you to concatenate two or more string fields. Here's an example:
This would add a full_name field to each instance of MyModel, which concatenates the first_name and last_name fields.
  
  
  from django.db.models import Concat, F

MyModel.objects.annotate(full_name=Concat('first_name', F('last_name'), output_field=CharField()))




Upper and Lower:
  These functions convert a string field to uppercase or lowercase, respectively. Here's an example:
This would add an upper_name and a lower_name field to each instance of MyModel, which convert the name field to uppercase and lowercase, respectively.

from django.db.models import Upper, Lower

MyModel.objects.annotate(upper_name=Upper('name'), lower_name=Lower('name'))




Substring: 
  This function allows you to extract a substring from a string field. Here's an example:
This would add a substring field to each instance of MyModel, which extracts a substring of length 3 starting from the second character of the name field.

from django.db.models import Substr

MyModel.objects.annotate(substring=Substr('name', 1, 3))




Length:
  This function returns the length of a string field. Here's an example:
This would add a name_length field to each instance of MyModel, which contains the length of the name field.

from django.db.models import Length

MyModel.objects.annotate(name_length=Length('name'))





Replace:
  This function allows you to replace a substring within a string field with another string. Here's an example
This would add a new_name field to each instance of MyModel, which replaces all occurrences of the substring "Old" within the name field with the string "New".

from django.db.models import Replace

MyModel.objects.annotate(new_name=Replace('name', 'Old', 'New'))




Trim: 
  This function allows you to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string field. Here's an example:
This would add a trimmed_name field to each instance of MyModel, which contains the name field with leading and trailing whitespace removed.


from django.db.models import Trim

MyModel.objects.annotate(trimmed_name=Trim('name'))




Left and Right:
  These functions allow you to extract a specified number of characters from the beginning or end of a string field, respectively. Here's an example:
This would add a left_name and a right_name field to each instance of MyModel, which contain the first three and last three characters of the name field, respectively.


from django.db.models import Left, Right

MyModel.objects.annotate(left_name=Left('name', 3), right_name=Right('name', 3))


RegexpReplace: 
  This function allows you to replace substrings within a string field based on a regular expression pattern. Here's an example:
This would add a new_name field to each instance of MyModel, which replaces all vowels within the name field with a hyphen ("-").


from django.db.models import RegexpReplace

MyModel.objects.annotate(new_name=RegexpReplace('name', r'[aeiou]', '-'))





Left:
  This function returns a specified number of characters from the beginning (left) of a string field.
  This would add a left_three_chars field to each instance of MyModel, which contains the first three characters of the name field.

from django.db.models.functions import Left

MyModel.objects.annotate(left_three_chars=Left('name', 3))




Length: This function returns the length of a string field.
  This would add a name_length field to each instance of MyModel, which contains the length of the name field.


  from django.db.models.functions import Length

MyModel.objects.annotate(name_length=Length('name'))



Lower: This function converts a string field to lowercase.
This would add a lower_name field to each instance of MyModel, which contains the name field converted to lowercase.

from django.db.models.functions import Lower

MyModel.objects.annotate(lower_name=Lower('name'))



LPad: 
  This function pads a string field on the left (beginning) with a specified character until it reaches a specified length.

This would add a padded_name field to each instance of MyModel, 
which contains the name field padded on the left with 0 characters until it reaches a length of 10 characters.

from django.db.models.functions import LPad

MyModel.objects.annotate(padded_name=LPad('name', 10, '0'))





LTrim:
  This function removes any whitespace characters from the beginning (left) of a string field.

This would add a trimmed_name field to each instance of MyModel, which contains the name field with any whitespace characters removed from the beginning.

from django.db.models.functions import LTrim

MyModel.objects.annotate(trimmed_name=LTrim('name'))




MD5:
  This function returns the MD5 hash of a string field.
This would add a name_hash field to each instance of MyModel, which contains the MD5 hash of the name field.


from django.db.models.functions import MD5

MyModel.objects.annotate(name_hash=MD5('name'))




Ord:
  This function returns the ASCII code for the first character of a string field.
This would add a first_char_code field to each instance of MyModel, which contains the ASCII code for the first character of the name field.


from django.db.models.functions import Ord

MyModel.objects.annotate(first_char_code=Ord('name'[0]))




Repeat: 
  This function repeats a string field a specified number of times.
This would add a repeated_name field to each instance of MyModel, which contains the name field repeated three times.

from django.db.models.functions import Repeat

MyModel.objects.annotate(repeated_name=Repeat('name', 3))



Replace:
  This function replaces all occurrences of a specified substring within a string field with another specified substring.

from django.db.models.functions import Replace

MyModel.objects.annotate(replaced_name=Replace
