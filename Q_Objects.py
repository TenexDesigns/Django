In Django, Q objects are used for complex lookups that involve OR conditions, nested queries, and negations.
Q objects are used in conjunction with the ORMs filter() method to create complex queries.

Heres an example of how to use Q objects to create a query with multiple OR conditions:


from django.db.models import Q

query = Q(name__icontains='john') | Q(name__icontains='jane')
results = MyModel.objects.filter(query)



In the above example, the query searches for records where the name field contains either 'john' or 'jane'.

You can also use Q objects for more complex lookups with nested queries. Here's an example:




query = Q(name__icontains='john') & (Q(age__gte=18) | Q(state='CA'))
results = MyModel.objects.filter(query)



In the above example, the query searches for records where the name field contains 'john' and the age is greater than or equal to 18 OR the state is 'CA'.

Finally, you can also use Q objects to create negated queries:


query = ~Q(name__icontains='john')
results = MyModel.objects.filter(query)


In the above example, the query searches for records where the name field does not contain 'john'.

By using Q objects, you can create complex queries that can't be expressed using simple filter arguments.
