To create a form in Rails to receive user data and create a new student object with fields for
first_name, last_name, and email, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Generate the Student Model
Run the following command in your Rails applications terminal to generate the Student model:


"rails generate model Student first_name:string last_name:string email:string"
      
This will create a migration file and the Student model file.

Step 2: Run Database Migrations
  
Run the following command in your terminal to migrate the database:


"rails db:migrate"
  
Step 3: Create a Controller
Generate a controller for the student model by running the following command:


"rails generate controller Students"

Step 4: Define Routes
Open the config/routes.rb file and add the following line to define the routes for the students:
  
  get 'students/new', to: 'students#new'
  post 'students', to: 'students#create'



Step 5: Create a New Action
In the app/controllers/students_controller.rb file, add the following code:


class StudentsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    @student = Student.new
  end

  def create
    @student = Student.new(student_params)
    if @student.save
      redirect_to @student
    else
      render 'new'
    end
  end

  private

  def student_params
    params.require(:student).permit(:first_name, :last_name, :email)
  end
end


Step 6: Create a New View
  
Create a new file called new.html.erb in the app/views/students directory, and add the following code:


<h1>New Student</h1>
<%= form_with(model: @student, url: students_path, local: true) do |form| %>
  <div>
    <%= form.label :first_name %>
    <%= form.text_field :first_name %>
  </div>
  <div>
    <%= form.label :last_name %>
    <%= form.text_field :last_name %>
  </div>
  <div>
    <%= form.label :email %>
    <%= form.email_field :email %>
  </div>
  <div>
    <%= form.submit %>
  </div>
<% end %>
Step 7: Create a Show Action
In the app/controllers/students_controller.rb file, add the following code:


def show
  @student = Student.find(params[:id])
end


Step 8: Create a Show View
  
Create a new file called show.html.erb in the app/views/students directory, and add the following code:


<h1><%= @student.first_name %> <%= @student.last_name %></h1>
<p>Email: <%= @student.email %></p>
  
Thats it! Now you should have a form to create a new student object with first_name, last_name, and email fields.
When the form is submitted, it will create a new student record in the database and redirect to the students show page,
displaying their details.












FOLLOW UP QUESTION --------------->How is data from fiorm submittend to create method in controller
*************************************************************************************************************


In Rails, when a form is submitted, the data is sent as an HTTP POST request to the server.
The create method in the controller is responsible for handling this request and creating a new student object with the submitted data.

Lets go through the steps of how the data from the form in the students/new URL is submitted to the create method in the controller:

When the form is submitted, the browser sends a POST request to the server with the form data.

The form data is then received by the create method in the StudentsController as part of the params hash.

In the create method, the line @student = Student.new(student_params) creates a new instance of the Student model, 
initializing it with the values from the student_params method.

The student_params method is a private method that filters the params
hash to only allow the specified attributes (:first_name, :last_name, and :email) to be assigned 
to the @student object. This is done to prevent any unauthorized or malicious data from being mass-assigned to the model.

Once the @student object is created, the if @student.save condition checks if the object
can be successfully saved to the database. If it can, the new student record is created in the database.

If the record is successfully saved, the line redirect_to @student redirects the user to the show action of 
the StudentsController and displays the newly created student's details.

If there are any validation errors or the record fails to save, the else block of the condition is executed,
rendering the new.html.erb view again, displaying the form with error messages.

By following this process, the data submitted through the form in the students/new URL 
is passed to the create method in the controller, allowing the creation of a new student object with the provided data.














FOLLOW UP QUESTION ---------------> Purose of "render :new" in create method in student controller
*************************************************************************************************************





So, the purpose of render 'new' in the create method is to re-display the form view with any error
messages when the student object fails to save,
allowing the user to fix any errors and submit the form again.



In the create method of the controller, the line render 'new' is used when there is an error while saving the student object.

When the form data fails validation or encounters an error during the save process,
the create action will render the new view again,
allowing the user to correct any errors and resubmit the form.
The render 'new' line ensures that the new.html.erb view is rendered with the form data preserved and 
error messages displayed.

By rendering the new view instead of redirecting to a different page, 
the user doesnt lose the data they entered in the form, and they can see the error messages indicating what went wrong.
This provides a better user experience and allows them to correct the mistakes without having to re-enter all the information.

So, the purpose of render 'new' in the create method is to re-display the form view with any error messages when the student object 
fails to save, allowing the user to fix any errors and submit the form again.















FOLLOW UP QUESTION --------------->Display error messages to user
*************************************************************************************************************

To display error messages to the user when the student object fails to save,
you can modify the new.html.erb view. Heres an updated version that includes error message display:


<h1>New Student</h1>
<%= form_with(model: @student, url: students_path, local: true) do |form| %>
  <% if @student.errors.any? %>
    <div id="error_explanation">
      <h2><%= pluralize(@student.errors.count, "error") %> prohibited this student from being saved:</h2>
      <ul>
        <% @student.errors.full_messages.each do |message| %>
          <li><%= message %></li>
        <% end %>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <% end %>

  <div>
    <%= form.label :first_name %>
    <%= form.text_field :first_name %>
  </div>
  <div>
    <%= form.label :last_name %>
    <%= form.text_field :last_name %>
  </div>
  <div>
    <%= form.label :email %>
    <%= form.email_field :email %>
  </div>
  <div>
    <%= form.submit %>
  </div>
<% end %>
In the above code, we added a check if @student.errors.any? to determine if there are any error messages.
If there are errors, it will display a div with an ID of error_explanation and iterate over each error message
using @student.errors.full_messages.each.

The error messages are displayed within an unordered list <ul> as individual list items <li>. 
This way, each error message will be presented in a clear and readable format.

By adding this code, any validation errors that occur during the saving process will be displayed to the user, 
providing them with information about what went wrong and how to correct it.













FOLLOW UP QUESTION --------------->How is data from fiorm submittend to create method in controller
*************************************************************************************************************

In the <%= form_with %> method, the url option specifies the URL where the form data will be sent when the form is submitted. 
In this case, students_path is used as the value for the url option.

students_path is a Rails route helper method that generates the URL for the create action of the StudentsController. 
It represents the endpoint where the form data will be submitted to create a new student object.

The local: true option is used to ensure that the form is submitted using a regular HTTP POST request rather than an AJAX request.
  When local: true is set, the form will be submitted to the server and the page will be refreshed after submission. 
    This is the default behavior when the local option is not specified.

By setting url: students_path, the form data will be sent to the create action of the StudentsController when the form is submitted, 
  allowing the controller to process the data and create a new student object.











FOLLOW UP QUESTION --------------->Use of the   
def new
      @student = Student.new
    end
*************************************************************************************************************

The purpose of the new action and @student = Student.new line is to initialize a new instance of the Student model.

In Rails, the new action is responsible for rendering the form that allows users to input data for creating a new
student object. By calling @student = Student.new,
we create a new empty instance of the Student model and assign it to the instance variable @student. 
This instance variable is then used in the view file to build the form fields.

The reason for creating a new instance of Student is to provide a template for the form fields. 
It ensures that the form fields are correctly associated with the Student model and its attributes (first_name, last_name, email). It also allows for any necessary validations or default values to be set on the model.

Although the new action itself doesnt create the student object, it prepares the form for user input
and initializes a new instance of the model, which is later used in the create action to actually save 
the submitted data and create a new student object based on that data.

















FOLLOW UP QUESTION ---------------The input view form wxplaind
*************************************************************************************************************

In the given context, there is no separate "view model" used. The instance variable @student serves as
the model object in the view. It represents an instance of the Student model class and holds the data entered by the user in the form.

In the view, the form is built using the form_with helper method. This method takes the @student object as
the model parameter, indicating that the form fields should be associated with the Student model.

The naming convention used in the form is based on Rails' conventions for form helpers. Let's break down the lines you mentioned:

erb
Copy code
<%= form.label :first_name %>
<%= form.text_field :first_name %>
form.label :first_name: This line generates a label for the first_name field in the form. 
    The :first_name symbol corresponds to the attribute name in the Student model.
form.text_field :first_name: This line creates a text input field for the first_name attribute 
    in the form. Again, :first_name is the attribute name from the Student model.
The naming convention helps in associating form fields with the correct attributes of the model. 
When the form is submitted, the values entered in the fields will be passed
to the corresponding attributes of the @student object, thanks to this naming convention.
