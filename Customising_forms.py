In Django, you can customize the forms used in the admin site by defining a custom ModelForm and using it in your custom ModelAdmin.
Heres an example:





# admin.py

from django.contrib import admin
from myapp.models import Book
from django import forms

class BookForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = '__all__'

    def clean_title(self):
        title = self.cleaned_data['title']
        if len(title) < 5:
            raise forms.ValidationError('Title must be at least 5 characters long.')
        return title

class BookAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    form = BookForm

admin.site.register(Book, BookAdmin)





In this example, weve defined a custom ModelForm for the Book model called BookForm. 
Weve specified the model to use in the Meta class, and also defined a custom validation method for the title field using the clean_title method. 
This validation method ensures that the title field is at least 5 characters long.

Weve then defined a custom ModelAdmin called BookAdmin, and specified the custom form to use for this model in the form attribute.




Finally, weve registered the Book model with the custom ModelAdmin in the admin site using the admin.site.register method.

Now, when we view the Book model in the admin site, the form will be rendered using our custom ModelForm,
which includes our custom validation method for the title field.

Exclude fields:
  You can exclude specific fields from the form by using the exclude option in both the ModelForm and ModelAdmin classes.
  If both classes define an exclude option, the ModelAdmin takes precedence

  
  from django import forms
from django.contrib import admin
from myapp.models import Person

class PersonForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Person
        exclude = ['name']

class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    exclude = ['age']
    form = PersonForm




Add custom validation:
  You can add custom validation to the admin by defining a ModelForm with custom validation methods and associating it with the ModelAdmin class



class MyArticleAdminForm(forms.ModelForm):
    def clean_name(self):
        # do something that validates your data
        return self.cleaned_data["name"]

class ArticleAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    form = MyArticleAdminForm







Override view methods: 
  You can override the view methods (change_view, add_view, etc.) 
  in the ModelAdmin class to customize the context data provided to the template that renders the view


class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    change_form_template = 'admin/myapp/extras/openstreetmap_change_form.html'
    
    def get_osm_info(self):
        pass

    def change_view(self, request, object_id, form_url='', extra_context=None):
        extra_context = extra_context or {}
        extra_context['osm_data'] = self.get_osm_info()
        return super().change_view(
            request, object_id, form_url, extra_context=extra_context,
        )



Customize templates: You can override the default admin templates by creating your own templates in your project's templates/admin directory



from django.contrib import admin
from .models import MyModel

class MyAdminSite(admin.AdminSite):
    site_header = 'Monty Python administration'

admin_site = MyAdminSite(name='myadmin')
admin_site.register(MyModel)



Remember to update your urls.py to reference your custom AdminSite subclass:



Each of these approaches has its own pros and cons, depending on the level of customization and complexity required for your project. 
By combining these techniques, you can create a highly customized admin interface for managing your models and data in Django.
