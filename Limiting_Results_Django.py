In Django, you can limit the number of results returned by a queryset using the slice or [:n] syntax.



1.For example, if you have a model called Person and you want to retrieve the first 10 records, you can use the following code:

This will return a queryset of the first 10 Person objects.


from myapp.models import Person

people = Person.objects.all()[:10]



2.You can also use the limit() method to limit the number of records returned.
For example, if you want to retrieve the first 5 records, you can use the following code:

people = Person.objects.all().limit(5)

This will return a queryset of the first 5 Person objects.



Note that the limit() method is not supported by all database backends, so it's recommended to use the slice or [:n] syntax instead



3.You can also use the offset() method to skip a certain number of records before retrieving the results. 
For example, if you want to retrieve records 6 to 10, you can use the following code:


people = Person.objects.all().order_by('id')[5:10]


This will return a queryset of the 6th to 10th Person objects, ordered by their primary key (id field).

In Django, you can limit the number of results returned by a QuerySet using slicing.
This approach is efficient because it issues the LIMIT clause directly to the database,
ensuring that slicing occurs at the database level instead of in Python stackoverflow.com.
For example, you can fetch the last 10 items like this:



User.objects.all().order_by('-id')[:10]



As Django QuerySets are lazy, the database is only hit when you specifically ask for the result stackoverflow.com.

However, slicing a QuerySet limits further filtering or manipulation of the QuerySet.
If you still need to pass a QuerySet instance around that can be further filtered or manipulated, 
you can use the set_limits method of the QuerySet's query object stackoverflow.com. Here's an example:





people = People.objects.order_by('name').filter(age__gt=65)  # unevaluated
people.query.set_limits(start, stop)  # still unevaluated
for person in people:  # now its evaluated
    person.do_the_thing()





Another aspect of limiting results in Django is rate-limiting API requests.
The Django REST Framework (DRF) provides several classes for implementing throttling in a Django application, such as AnonRateThrottle and UserRateThrottle. 
You can configure these classes and set the number of requests per period for each type of user in the settings.py file



REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',
        'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle'
    ],
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
        'anon': '2/min',
        'user': '4/min'
    }
}



In summary, you can limit the number of results in Django using slicing, set_limits,
and rate-limiting API requests with DRFs throttling classes. Each method has its own use case and tradeoffs. 
Slicing is suitable for limiting results at the database level, while set_limits allows further filtering and manipulation of QuerySets. 
Rate-limiting API requests with DRFs throttling classes helps control resource usage and prevents abuse of your APIs.
