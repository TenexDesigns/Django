In Django, a QuerySet is a collection of database objects that can be filtered, ordered, and manipulated in various ways. 
QuerySets are used extensively in Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to retrieve and manipulate data from a database.

To retrieve a subset of objects based on certain criteria, you can use the filter() method on a QuerySet.
For example, to retrieve all the objects where the status field is set to "published", you can do:




published_objects = MyModel.objects.filter(status='published')




Once you have a QuerySet, you can perform various operations on it, such as ordering, slicing, and aggregating.
For example, to order the objects by the created field in descending order, you can do:



published_objects = published_objects.order_by('-created')



To get a specific subset of objects, you can use slicing. For example, to get the first 10 published objects, you can do:
  
  published_objects = published_objects[:10]

  
  To perform aggregation operations, such as counting or averaging,
  you can use the aggregate() method on a QuerySet. For example, to count the number of published objects, you can do:


    published_count = published_objects.count()

    
    Now, coming to the question about managers in Django, a manager is a class that is responsible for retrieving objects from the database. 
    Every model in Django has at least one manager, which is the default manager. 
    You can define custom managers for a model by subclassing the models.Manager class and adding your own methods to it.

Custom managers can be used to encapsulate common query sets and methods that are used to retrieve objects from the database. 
For example, if you have a Product model and you often need to retrieve only the available products, 
you can define a custom manager that encapsulates this query set:


  
  class AvailableProductManager(models.Manager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return super().get_queryset().filter(is_available=True)

      
      You can then use this custom manager to retrieve only the available products:
        
        
        available_products = Product.objects.available()

        
        In this example, the available() method is a custom method added 
        to the Product model that uses the AvailableProductManager to retrieve only the available products.
