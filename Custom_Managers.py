In Django, a manager is an interface through which database query operations are provided to models. 
Every Django model has at least one default manager, but you can define custom managers as well to provide additional query capabilities.

Heres an example of a custom manager that only returns active records:


from django.db import models

class ActiveManager(models.Manager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return super().get_queryset().filter(is_active=True)



To use this manager, you would add it to your model like this:


class MyModel(models.Model):
    # fields...
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)

    objects = models.Manager()
    active_objects = ActiveManager()




With this definition, you can use the active_objects manager to get only active records:

MyModel.active_objects.all() # returns only active records



Custom managers can have many benefits, including:
  
They can simplify complex queries by encapsulating them into easy-to-use methods.
They can provide more specific query results than the default manager, which can be useful for larger applications with more complex data models.
They can be used to implement business logic or restrictions on the returned data.
They can improve performance by only returning the data that is actually needed, instead of retrieving and processing large amounts of data.





In general, using a custom manager can make your code more maintainable and easier to understand by encapsulating complex logic in one place. 
Additionally, by making sure that only the relevant data is retrieved from the database,
custom managers can help to reduce load times and improve the overall performance of your application.

Custom managers in Django are used to provide additional methods to interact with the database, and they can be useful for applying filters,
modifying query sets, or adding functionality to the default manager. A custom manager can be created by subclassing models.
Manager and defining additional methods on that class. Then, you can assign an instance of the custom manager to a model as a class attribute




Heres an example of a custom manager:




from django.db import models

class CustomManager(models.Manager):
    def custom_method(self):
        # Custom logic here
        pass

class MyModel(models.Model):
    # Model fields
    objects = CustomManager()




In this example, we create a custom manager called CustomManager that subclasses models.Manager. We then define a custom method called custom_method.
Finally, we assign an instance of CustomManager to the objects attribute of MyModel. Now, we can use the custom method like this:




my_objects = MyModel.objects.custom_method()




There are several benefits to using custom managers:



They allow you to encapsulate logic related to querying the database, making your code more maintainable and reusable stackoverflow.com.
They can be used to create custom query sets that filter data based on certain conditions, which can simplify your code and make it more readable




Heres an example of using a custom manager to filter data based on certain conditions:



class ActiveUserManager(models.Manager):
    def active_users(self):
        return self.filter(is_active=True)

class User(models.Model):
    # Model fields
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    objects = ActiveUserManager()





In this example, we create a custom manager called ActiveUserManager that filters the users based on the is_active attribute.
 We can now use the custom manager to get all active users like this:


active_users = User.objects.active_users()



This approach is more readable and maintainable compared to using the default manager and filtering the data directly in the code


active_users = User.objects.filter(is_active=True)





In conclusion, custom managers in Django offer several advantages, such as encapsulating database query logic, 
creating custom query sets, and improving the readability of your code. 
By subclassing models.Manager and defining additional methods, you can create custom managers that suit your specific needs
