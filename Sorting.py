SORTING 

In Django ORM, you can use the order_by() method to sort query sets based on one or more fields.
The order_by() method takes one or more arguments, which should be the field names to sort the queryset by.



1.--------------
For example, if you have a model called Person with fields name and age, and you want to sort the queryset by age, you can use the following code:
This will return a queryset of all Person objects sorted by age in ascending order.


from myapp.models import Person

people = Person.objects.all().order_by('age')

2.You can also sort the queryset in descending order by using the - prefix before the field name:
This will return a queryset of all Person objects sorted by age in descending order.

people = Person.objects.all().order_by('-age')



3.You can also sort the queryset by multiple fields by passing multiple arguments to order_by(). 
For example, if you want to sort the queryset first by age in descending order, and then by name in ascending order, you can use the following code:

people = Person.objects.all().order_by('-age', 'name')


This will return a queryset of all Person objects sorted by age in descending order, and then by name in ascending order.



HERE IS SOME MORE EXPLANATION
*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************

1.To sort query sets in Django ORM, you can use the order_by() method on a query set. This method accepts one or more field names as arguments,
where a field name is preceded by a hyphen - to sort in descending order and without a hyphen for ascending order. Heres a basic example:

This query sorts the Author objects first by the score field in descending order and then by the last_name field in ascending order  

ordered_authors = Author.objects.order_by('-score', 'last_name')



2.You can also use built-in and custom lookups in ordering by using the annotate() method with the order_by() method.
For example, if you want to sort by the lowercase version of the name field:
  
  This query first annotates the Blog objects with a new field name_lower that contains the lowercase version of the name field,
  and then orders the objects by the name_lower field


from django.db.models import CharField
from django.db.models.functions import Lower

CharField.register_lookup(Lower)
ordered_blogs = Blog.objects.annotate(name_lower=Lower('name')).order_by('name_lower')




3.In case you want to perform complex queries, you can use Q objects with the | (OR) operator:
  This query selects objects where x=1 or y=2
  
  
  from django.db.models import Q

Model.objects.filter(Q(x=1) | Q(y=2))




4.If you need to reverse the order of a query set, you can use the reverse() method:
  
  Keep in mind that reverse() should generally be called on a query set with a defined ordering. 
  If no ordering is defined, calling reverse() has no real effect
  
  my_queryset.reverse()

To sum up, you can sort query sets in Django ORM using the order_by() method,
combined with other methods like annotate(), Q objects, and reverse() for more complex sorting scenarios.
