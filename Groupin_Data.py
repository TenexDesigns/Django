In Django ORM, you can group data by one or more fields using the annotate() method in conjunction with the values() method. Here's an example:

Suppose you have a model called Book with fields title, author, published_date, and price. 
To group the books by author and calculate the total price for each author, you can use the following query:


from django.db.models import Sum

books_by_author = Book.objects.values('author').annotate(total_price=Sum('price'))



This will return a QuerySet with the total price for each author.

If you want to group the books by both author and year, you can add the published_date field to the values() method:



books_by_author_and_year = Book.objects.values('author', 'published_date__year').annotate(total_price=Sum('price'))



This will order the groups by the author field in ascending order.

Note that when grouping data, you must use the annotate() method to add an aggregate function to the query.
Additionally, you can use any of the aggregate functions available in Django, such as Count, Avg, Max, Min, and StdDev.
