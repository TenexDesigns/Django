In Django, F objects are used to reference model fields and perform database operations using their values.

Here are some examples of how to use F objects to reference fields in Django:


Simple field reference: 
  To reference a model field using an F object, you can simply pass the field name as a string. 
  For example, to filter objects where the price field is greater than the discounted_price field,
  you can use the following code: MyModel.objects.filter(price__gt=F('discounted_price'))




Arithmetic operations: 
  You can perform arithmetic operations on fields using F objects. 
  For example, to update the price field to be twice the value of the discounted_price field,
  you can use the following code: MyModel.objects.update(price=F('discounted_price') * 2)




Aggregation:
  You can use F objects with aggregation functions like Sum, Avg, Max, and Min to perform calculations on fields.
  For example, to get the sum of the price field for all objects, you can use the following code: MyModel.objects.aggregate(total_price=Sum('price'))



Cross model references:
  You can use F objects to reference fields on related models using the double underscore notation.
  For example, to filter MyModel objects where the price field is greater than the price field of the related ForeignKeyModel,
  you can use the following code: MyModel.objects.filter(price__gt=F('foreignkeymodel__price'))




Conditional expressions:
  You can use F objects with conditional expressions to perform conditional operations on fields.
  For example, to update the status field to "on sale" if the price field is less than the discounted_price field,
  you can use the following code: MyModel.objects.update(status=Case(When(price__lt=F('discounted_price'), then='on sale'), default='regular'))




Comparison between two fields of the same model:
  You can compare two fields of the same model using F objects. For example, 
  to filter MyModel objects where the price field is greater than the cost field, 
  you can use the following code: MyModel.objects.filter(price__gt=F('cost')).




Updating multiple fields at once:
  You can update multiple fields at once using F objects. 
  For example, to increase the price field by 10 and the discounted_price field by 5, 
  you can use the following code: MyModel.objects.update(price=F('price')+10, discounted_price=F('discounted_price')+5).




Using F objects with conditional expressions: 
  You can use F objects with conditional expressions to perform conditional operations on multiple fields. 
  For example, to update the status field to "on sale" if the price field is less than the discounted_price 
  field and the in_stock field is True, you can use the following code: 
    MyModel.objects.update(status=Case(When(price__lt=F('discounted_price') & in_stock=True, then='on sale'), default='regular')).



Using F objects with Count aggregation function: 
  You can use F objects with the Count aggregation function to count objects 
  where a field meets certain criteria. For example, to count the number of MyModel objects where the price field is greater than the average price,
  you can use the following code: MyModel.objects.filter(price__gt=Avg('price')).aggregate(count=Count(F('id'))).



Using F objects with Subquery function:
  You can use F objects with the Subquery function to perform subqueries and filter related models.
  For example, to get a list of MyModel objects where the price field is greater than the average price of the related ForeignKeyModel, you can use the following code:
    MyModel.objects.filter(price__gt=Subquery(ForeignKeyModel.objects.filter(my_model=OuterRef('pk')).values('price').annotate(avg_price=Avg('price')).values('avg_price')[:1])).

Referencing fields using F objects in Django allows you to compare the value of a model field with another field on the 
same model or perform arithmetic operations on fields within a query.
This can be particularly useful when you need to filter query results based on relationships between fields in the same model.


Lets start with a basic example. Suppose you want to filter all Entry objects where the number of comments is greater than the number of pingbacks:


from django.db.models import F
Entry.objects.filter(number_of_comments__gt=F("number_of_pingbacks"))




In this example, an F object is used to reference the number_of_pingbacks field and compare it with the number_of_comments field docs.djangoproject.com.

You can also perform arithmetic operations using F objects. For instance, if you want to filter all entries where the number of comments
is more than twice the number of pingbacks:





Entry.objects.filter(number_of_comments__gt=F("number_of_pingbacks") * 2)




Or, filter all entries where the rating is less than the sum of the number of comments and number of pingbacks:



Entry.objects.filter(rating__lt=F("number_of_comments") + F("number_of_pingbacks"))




F objects can also be used to span relationships using the double underscore notation. This will introduce any necessary joins to access the related object.
For example, to retrieve all entries where the author's name is the same as the blog name:






Entry.objects.filter(author__name=F("blog__name"))





You can combine F objects with Q objects to execute more complex queries. Q objects can be combined using the &, |, and ^ operators and can be negated using the ~ operator. 
For example, to filter all entries where the number of comments is greater than the number of pingbacks and the author's name is "John":



from django.db.models import Q
Entry.objects.filter(Q(number_of_comments__gt=F("number_of_pingbacks")) & Q(author__name="John"))
