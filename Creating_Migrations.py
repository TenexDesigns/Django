Migrations

In django we use migrations to create and update our databases tables based offf of the models we have in our project.
So in django, we are not going to manually create and modifiy our database tables, we are going to let django take care of that through the migrations.


After creating all your model classes, then run this command


-------> py manage.py makemigrations



After this command , django looks for all installed apps in our project , and for each app, it created a new migration file.

This files are put in the migrations folder and are given a sequence.
