IT IS RECOMMENEDED TO USE THE VALUES() METHOD , THESE OTHER METHODS LIKE ONLY() AND DEFFERED() ARE TIME COMSUMING

In Django, you can select specific fields to query using the values() method on a QuerySet object. 
This method allows you to specify the fields you want to include in the query results.

Heres an example of how to use the values() method to select specific fields in a Django model:


from myapp.models import MyModel

# Get a QuerySet of MyModel objects with only the 'id' and 'name' fields selected
my_objects = MyModel.objects.values('id', 'name')

# Iterate over the QuerySet and print the selected fields for each object
for obj in my_objects:
    print(obj['id'], obj['name'])



    
    In the example above, the values() method is called on the MyModel.objects QuerySet object to select only the id and name fields. 
    The resulting QuerySet contains dictionaries with the selected fields as keys and their values as values. 
    In the for loop, we iterate over each dictionary in the QuerySet and print the id and name values for each object.





Note that when you use values(), youll get back a list of dictionaries rather than a list of model instances, 
so youll need to use dictionary syntax to access the fields.
If you need to include all fields in the query, you can use the values() method without any arguments, like this:



my_objects = MyModel.objects.values()




This will return a QuerySet with all fields in the model.

*************************************************************************************************************************************

To select specific fields in a Django query, you can use the following methods:

But it is recommended to use the values() method. The only method consumes a lot of time.

values() and values_list() methods:

These methods return dictionaries or tuples instead of queryset objects,
which can reduce the amount of work the database has to do. 
However, they do not support relations like file.url or file.name in templates or views.

Example: To retrieve the first_name and last_name of users whose name starts with "R", you can use the following query:


User.objects.filter(first_name__startswith='R').values('first_name', 'last_name')







only() method:

This method allows you to specify only the fields you want to retrieve in your query.
However, it still returns a queryset object that allows you to use the relations in templates or views.

Example: To retrieve only the blog_name and title fields from the Articles model, you can use the following query:


Articles.objects.only('blog__name', 'title')





annotate() method with F expressions:

This method allows you to create new fields in your queryset by using F expressions to reference fields from related models.

Example: To retrieve the title and the related blog_name from the Articles model, you can use the following query


from django.db.models import F
Articles.objects.annotate(blog_name=F('blog__name'))





Raw SQL queries:

You can use the raw() method to perform raw SQL queries that return model instances.
However, this approach is less flexible and less secure than using Django's ORM methods.

Example: To retrieve only the first_name field from the Person model, you can use the following query:


Person.objects.raw('SELECT id, first_name FROM myapp_person')





Note that the primary key field must always be included in a raw query, otherwise a FieldDoesNotExist exception will be raised.

Each of these approaches has its own trade-offs and use cases. Using only() or values() methods is recommended for most situations, as they provide a good balance between performance and flexibility.
However, if you need more control over your query, you can use annotate() with F expressions or raw SQL queries.
